# # Reddit Slack Bot
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to set up a simple workflow to search for
# Reddit posts of interest and send them to a Slack channel. We will make use
# of `secrets` to store Reddit and Slack credentials, and `LaunchPlans` to schedule
# workflows at constant interval, so we never miss a Reddit post we might be
# interested in.

# ## Creating Secrets to Access Reddit and Slack
#
# For our workflow to access Reddit and Slack, we need to set up some credentials
# with Slack and Reddit, and share them with our workflow in a safe way. For Reddit,
# we create a [developer app](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) which will give
# us a client ID and secret. We will refer to these as `reddit_client_id` and `reddit_secret_key`.
# Once we have collected our `reddit_client_id` and `reddit_secret_key`,
# we securely store them using the `unionai` CLI tool. To add `reddit_client_id` we run:
# ```bash
# unionai create secret reddit_client_id
# ```
# and paste the client ID when prompted.
#
# After, we can do the same for `reddit_secret_key`.

# For Slack, we will need a Slack API bot token which can be configured and created for
# a specific channel by following
# [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tracks/getting-a-token). We
# will call this token `slack_token`.  Similar to how we added `reddit_client_id` and `reddit_secret_key`,
# we securely store the `slack_token` in the CLI using:
# ```bash
# unionai create secret slack_token
# ```

# Once our secrets are set up, we continue by importing some of the workflow dependencies
# and setting some constants like the frequency in which we want to run the workflow,
# the Slack channel we want to post to, and the reference names of our secrets:

from typing import List, Dict
from flytekit import (
    task,
    workflow,

SLACK_CHANNEL_NAME = "#reddit-posts"
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID = "reddit_client_id"
REDDIT_SECRET_KEY = "reddit_secret_key"
SLACK_TOKEN = "slack_token"

# ## Defining a Container Image
#
# The previously imported packages are either in the Python Standard Library or included by
# default in the base flyte image used by Union. However, if we want to include additional
# packages we define an `ImageSpec` which will create an image under the hood, so we don't
# have to worry about writing a `Dockerfile`.

image = ImageSpec(
    registry=os.environ.get("IMAGE_SPEC_REGISTRY"), packages=["slack_sdk==3.28.0"]
)

# ## Collecting Reddit Posts
#
# For our task, to use `reddit_client_id` and `reddit_secret_key`, we
# specify them in the `@task` decorator using the `secret_requests` argument. Then all we need
# to do is format a request and parst the result. We will only return posts since the last
# time we ran the workflow; specified by `DAYS_BETWEEN_RUNS`.

# We also make use of caching by setting `cache=True` in the `@task` decorator. By adding
# `kickoff_time` and `lookback_days` as arguments to the task we keep the function code
# independent of the current time. Now if `get_posts` ever gets called multiple times, we will
# not make unnecessary requets to the reddit API.

# To register and activate this `LaunchPlan` we run:
# ```bash
# unionai register tutorials/reddit_slack_bot/
# unionai launchplan flyte_reddit_posts --activate
# ```

# Our workflow will now run on the configured schedule until we deactivate the `LaunchPlan` either in the UI or using:
# ```bash
# unionai launchplan flyte_reddit_posts --deactivate
# ```

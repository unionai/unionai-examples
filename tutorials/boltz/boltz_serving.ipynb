    "# Hosting a Boltz Serving App\n",
    "\n",
    "[Boltz](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz) is an open-source biomolecular structure prediction model with performance on par with Alphafold3. This notebook details a simple boltz prediction task as well as how to serve a prediction endpoint using FastAPI and Union Serving.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "- Define a [remote object](https://docs.union.ai/byoc/user-guide/development-cycle/union-remote/) to interact with the Union cluster\n",
    "- Materialize an Artifact representing the [model on Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/boltz-community/boltz-1)\n",
    "- Create an [ImageSpec](https://docs.union.ai/byoc/user-guide/development-cycle/image-spec#imagespec) definition for use throughout\n",
    "- Create a simple prediction workflow using [Actors](https://docs.union.ai/byoc/user-guide/core-concepts/actors/#actors)\n",
    "- Define a FastAPI serving endpoint\n",
    "- Deploy the app via Union [Serving](https://docs.union.ai/byoc/user-guide/core-concepts/serving/#serving)\n",

This results in faster iterations between tasks as well as enabling substantial improvements during large parallel executions.\n",

Additionally, we define a replica count and a time-to-live to control parallelism capacity as well as how long to persist between task submissions. Once defined, the actor environment can be used in exactly the same way as the usual `@task` decorator.\n",

The former is fairly self-explanatory, however the latter manages the execution of the Boltz process, yielding empty bytes during processing to maintain the connection. By implementing this as an asynchronous generator, we ensure our web server remains responsive during potentially long-running Boltz computations.\n",

    "Next, we construct and execute the Boltz command with appropriate parameters, including any custom options provided by the client. We've implemented flexibility here - if an MSA file is provided, we use it directly; otherwise, we instruct Boltz to use the `mmseqs2` MSA server for sequence alignments.\n",
    "We're careful to implement robust error handling throughout our application, capturing and returning meaningful error messages if something goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the results are streamed back to the client using FastAPI's StreamingResponse, which efficiently delivers the compressed output while setting appropriate headers to prompt the client to handle it as a downloadable file."

    "\n",
    "Following that, we define our FastAPI application deployment. The `App` class encapsulates all the specifications needed to run our service in a containerized environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We give our application a name (`boltz-fastapi-notebook`) for identification within the Union system.\n",
    "- We specify the same ImageSpec we've used throughout.\n",
    "- We define an input via the Artifact's `query()` method, downloading it and mounting it at the specified path (`/tmp/.boltz_cache`).\n",
    "- We establish resource limits for our application, including CPU, memory, GPU, and storage requirements.\n",
    "- We set the port our application will listen on and specify the above file to include in the deployment.\n",
    "- We define the command line arguments needed to start our FastAPI server using Uvicorn.\n",
    "- We configure environment variables, such as enabling PyTorch MPS fallback for better compatibility.\n",
    "- We set up auto-scaling parameters, including the minimum and maximum number of replicas, the scale-down timing, and the metric that triggers scaling (in this case, request rate).\n",
    "- Finally, we specify the GPU accelerator type we need, which is an NVIDIA L40S in this implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After configuring our application, we prepare for deployment by creating an `AppRemote` instance using the same `remote` object we've been using.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final step, we deploy our Boltz FastAPI application to the Union platform by calling the `deploy` method on our `AppRemote` instance. This initiates the deployment process, which will provision the necessary infrastructure, deploy our container, and make our Boltz service available according to the specifications we've defined. This will create a publicly accessible URL that leverages the same auth and RBAC as the rest of your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This deployment approach allows our Boltz service to automatically scale based on demand, efficiently utilize GPU resources when needed, and maintain high availability with minimum replicas always running."

Head on over to that endpoint and add `/docs/` to the end to pull up the `/predict/` endpoint specification. You can then try it out by passing in `prot.yaml` and `seq.a3m`. Once the prediction has run, you'll have the option to download a tarfile containing the results. Unarchiving it and looking in the predictions folder, you'll find a `.cif` file. This Crystallographic Information File contains the predicted structure of the below sequence. This can then be uploaded to [Molstar](https://molstar.org/viewer/) to view and interact with the structure.\n",

We ran a more traditional workflow in an accelerated way via Actors. We also stood up a persistent app for serving predictions in a flexible and cost effective way using Union Serving. \n",

"""Triage a support ticket with one System One call.

The battery below asks **fourteen** questions. That is the point: System One
answers them in parallel and in isolation, so asking fourteen costs about what
asking three costs, and every extra question is one more thing your code can
branch on without another round trip. A generative model would have to write all
fourteen fields out one token at a time.

"""Fan a battery out across a queue of tickets.

Two kinds of parallelism stack here, and they are worth telling apart: Flyte runs
one durable task per ticket across the cluster, and inside each task System One
answers the whole battery in a single request. The second one is why the per-case
latency barely moves when you add questions.

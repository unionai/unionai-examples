# # Slurm connector - an existing sbatch script, and a task that consumes it
# `slurm_script` submits a script unchanged: no container, no Flyte SDK in the image, no
# edits to the script. Flyte contributes submission, phase reporting, retries, cancellation
# (`scancel`), log retrieval and caching.
#
# Inputs arrive as environment variables - scalars as `FLYTE_INPUT_<NAME>`, `File`/`Dir` as
# their URI. A script cannot write Flyte's own output format, so declared outputs work the
# same way in reverse: the plugin hands the script a destination per output as
# `FLYTE_OUTPUT_<NAME>` and records each one once the job succeeds.
#
# By default that destination is a **local path** and the connector streams the file to
# object storage afterwards, so the compute node needs no upload tool and no credentials -
# which is what this example uses. Pass `output_upload="job"` and the destination becomes the
# object-storage URI for the script to upload to directly; that is the right choice for
# anything large, since the connector refuses to carry more than 100 MB.
#
# Connection details come from FLYTE_SLURM_HOST / FLYTE_SLURM_USERNAME /
# FLYTE_SLURM_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY on the connector, or set host/username/ssh_private_key here.

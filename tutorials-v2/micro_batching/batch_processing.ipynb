    "### 1. Failure transparency with @flyte.trace\n",
    "The `@flyte.trace` decorator creates automatic checkpoints:\n",
    "- **What it does:** Records inputs and outputs of decorated functions\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** If a task fails, it resumes from the last successful checkpoint\n",

    "- **Automatic scaling:** Replicas scale between min/max based on workload\n",
    "- **Resource optimization:** Dramatically reduced startup overhead\n",

    "### Key Benefits:\n",
    "- **Automatic checkpointing** at batch and operation boundaries  \n",

    "This notebook demonstrated a production-ready micro-batching pattern for Flyte v2 that combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reusable Containers** for efficiency\n",
    "2. **@flyte.trace** for checkpointing and recovery\n",
    "3. **Massive parallelism** via async/await\n",
    "4. **Robust error handling** for resilience\n",

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Use `@flyte.trace` for non-deterministic operations\n",
    "- Monitor resource usage and optimize incrementally\n",
    "- Choose the right pattern for your specific use case\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Adapt this pattern to your specific use case\n",
    "- Replace mock functions with real API calls\n",
    "- Test with your actual dataset\n",
